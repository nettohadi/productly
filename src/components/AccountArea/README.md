# AccountArea Component Refactoring

## Overview

This document outlines the refactoring of the `AccountArea` component. The refactoring focuses on enhancing performance, readability, maintainability, and incorporating best practices in React development.

## Changes and Improvements

### Introduction of `useQuery` from TanStack Query

- Replaced the manual fetch call with `useQuery` for fetching product data.
- **Benefit**: Enhances code readability and maintainability, and provides built-in states for loading and error handling.

### Refactoring Token Validation and Navigation

- Implemented `useAuthToken` hook for JWT token validation and navigation.
- **Benefit**: Encapsulates token validation logic, improving reusability and separation of concerns.

### Use of `jwtDecode` for Token Decoding

- Corrected the JWT decoding method from `jwt_decode` to `jwtDecode`.
- **Benefit**: Ensures the use of the correct function from the `jwt-decode` library, improving the reliability of token parsing.

### Enhanced Error Handling

- Integrated `ErrorMessage` component to handle and display errors.
- **Benefit**: Offers a consistent and reusable method for error presentation.

### UI and UX Enhancements

- Added missing product descriptions to the product listing.
- **Benefit**: Improves user experience by providing complete information about products.

### useMemo for ProgressBar Width Calculation

- Utilized `useMemo` for calculating the progress bar's width.
- **Benefit**: Prevents unnecessary recalculations on each render, improving performance.

### Correction of Progress Bar Width Logic

- Fixed the progress bar width calculation by appending a "%" to the style.
- **Benefit**: The original code lacked the "%" in the width style, leading to incorrect display. Adding "%" ensures accurate representation of the loaded product percentage.

## Conclusion

The refactored `AccountArea` component now offers enhanced performance, readability, and maintainability. These improvements align with modern React best practices, contributing to a more efficient and user-friendly application.
