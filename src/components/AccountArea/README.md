# AccountArea Component Refactoring

## Overview

This document outlines the refactoring of the `AccountArea` component. The refactoring focuses on enhancing performance, readability, maintainability, and incorporating best practices in React development.

## Changes and Improvements

### Introduction of `useQuery` from TanStack Query

- Replaced the manual fetch call with `useQuery` for fetching product data.
- **Rationale**: Enhances code readability and maintainability, and provides built-in states for loading and error handling.

### Refactoring Token Validation and Navigation

- Implemented `useAuthToken` hook for JWT token validation and navigation.
- **Rationale**: Encapsulates token validation logic, improving reusability and separation of concerns.

### useMemo for ProgressBar Width Calculation

- Utilized `useMemo` for calculating the progress bar's width.
- **Rationale**: Prevents unnecessary recalculations on each render, improving performance.

### Enhanced Error Handling

- Integrated `ErrorMessage` component to handle and display errors.
- **Rationale**: Offers a consistent and reusable method for error presentation.

### UI and UX Enhancements

- Added missing product descriptions to the product listing.
- **Rationale**: Improves user experience by providing complete information about products.

### Styling and Layout Adjustments

- Enhanced CSS classes for improved layout and styling.
- **Rationale**: Boosts the visual appeal and user experience of the component.

### Correction of Progress Bar Width Logic

- Fixed the progress bar width calculation by appending a "%" to the style.
- **Rationale**: The original code lacked the "%" in the width style, leading to incorrect display. Adding "%" ensures accurate representation of the loaded product percentage.

## Conclusion

The refactored `AccountArea` component now offers enhanced performance, readability, and maintainability. These improvements align with modern React best practices, contributing to a more efficient and user-friendly application.
